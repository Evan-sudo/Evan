If u study at Western countries, ur given priority. 
If u publish in top-tier conferences, ur given priority.
If u earn a high salary, ur given priority. 

People are reluctant to acknowledge their envy or admit to bad luck; hence, they often curate a glamorous persona online, opting to sell anxiety rather than cease the relentless comparisons. However, during my PhD studies, I have also come to recognize a different perspective. 
Domestic universities do boast groups that rival or surpass those in the West. Also, even if a paper isnâ€™t published in a top conference, the work can still be solid. Similarly, my sister, with her average income, continues to inspire me with the richness of her life. 
Luck and merit should always be seen as separate entities. While good luck is undoubtedly beneficial, relying on it to assert one's priority only mires the competitive world further. True merit might be temporarily obscured by luck, but it will not be forever forsaken by the world.
Life is already too short, so why should I internalize struggles over the lucks of others, over realities I cannot change? Instead, I choose to focus on myself. Continually investing in my personal growth allows me to see beyond the exaggerations and the noise. No matter how fervent the competition becomes, I refuse to let it undermine my own abilities.
